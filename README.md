1. **Weather App**: A simple weather application that retrieves weather information for a given location using an API.

2. **Password Generator**: A password generator tool that generates random passwords of specified length and complexity.

3. **Calculator**: A basic calculator application with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Tkinter.
